Diamond Price Prediction Model:-

Technologies Used:
Data Handling and Manipulation: Pandas and NumPy for data loading, cleaning, and transformation.
Data Visualization: Matplotlib and Seaborn for creating visualizations like scatter plots, box plots, and heatmaps to gain insights into the data.
Machine Learning: Scikit-learn for building and evaluating the regression model.
Includes preprocessing tools like StandardScaler, OneHotEncoder, and LabelEncoder.
Uses the Linear Regression model for prediction.
Employs metrics like RMSE and R-squared for evaluating model performance.

Regression Model:A Linear Regression model was used to predict diamond prices.
Numerical features were scaled using StandardScaler.
Categorical features were encoded using OneHotEncoder/LabelEncoder.
The model was trained on 75% of the data and tested on the remaining 25%.

Accuracy:The model achieved an R-squared (R2) value of approximately 0.86. This suggests that the model can explain around 92% of the variance in diamond prices.
The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is around 1478.32, suggesting an average prediction error of roughly $1478.

Outcome:The project successfully built a diamond price prediction model using linear regression.
The model demonstrated reasonably good accuracy with an R-squared value of 0.92.
Further improvements could be explored by experimenting with different regression models, feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning.
